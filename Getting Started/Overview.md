# Overview

For those familiar with gRPC and looking to dive into code, it may make more sense to skip straight to the [Intro](firecomm.github.io/docs/gettingstarted/intro). This section seeks to provide a brief overview of the core concepts of Firecomm, which mirror the core concepts of gRPC.

> Firecomm is a framework for gRPC which allows Node.js developers to quickly spin up powerful gRPC microservice communication architectures with a simplified API.

Firecomm was designed by a team of Node.js engineers who designed an interal wrapper for Google's gRPC-node library in their microservice architecture journey. Along the way, they created a more consistent and DRY syntax, with support for features like SSL, health-check, and   decided to open-source the project.

The project is continually maintained, so for those looking to contribute, please do not hesitate to [message the Firecomm team](mailto://firecommgrpc@gmail.com), or make an Issue/PR on our [Github repository](https://github.com/firecomm/firecomm).
